Parts:

    2.5m Panopticon Command Pod
    1.25m Cyclops Command Pod
    0.625m Mono Pressurized Command Chair
    ~0.2m Micro Lander Leg; radial and ventral mount configurations
    ~0.3m Micro Advanced Grabber Unit.

Known issues:

    Having multiple transparent pods in physics range is very resource intensive. Too many will crash the game.
    Flight HUD will render Black instead of Green in OpenGL mode.
    Lighting direction from Sun incorrect in IVA at some parts of day, due to Squad's funky IVA orientation setup.
    One of the stack nodes on Mono Pod will snap to, but not attach to other stack nodes, if the Mono Pod is not the root part.
    Micro lander legs clip into ground if retract/deployed while landed. same appears to happen with the smallest stock lander leg.
